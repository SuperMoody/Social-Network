I'm busy said the sea, I'm busy think of me, Making continents to be, I'm busy said the sea.

I'm busy said the rain, When I fall it's not invain, Wait and you will see the grain, I'm busy said the rain.

I'm busy said the air, blowing here and blowing there, Up and down and everywhere, I'm busy said the air.

Sea and rain and air and sun.
